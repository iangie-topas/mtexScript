For small 2D detector in laboratorial XRD system, Phi scans at several Chi tilts are necessary to cover all the directions in the upper hemisphere of the sample. 
These two functions in MatLab code can help merge two measured pole figures (with overlapping area) imported by MTex ToolBox. A linear weighting factor of the overlapping area was considered. The function "IntenMerge" calls the Function "WeightMatrix". #mtexScript
